## File-lock UI


### Fix

- WIN issues with quotes when passing command:

-- No quotes around path -> error when whitespace in path
-- With quotes -> command does not pass for directories

- likely: escaping issues as quote before path seems to be missing from logs


### Tasks

- create executable
- build script
